# pygameui

A dead-simple UI for Pygame written during a quick 2-3 hour hack.

Hopefully this is useful for your game prototypes.

## Environment

Tested on Mac OS X 10.7.3 running system Python 2.7.1 and Pygame installed via
the "Lion apple supplied python" mpkg.  Please let me know if you have issues
running this on other versions of Python and/or Pygame.
